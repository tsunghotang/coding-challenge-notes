# Savings Account

https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/exercises/savings-account



---

In this exercise you will be working with savings accounts. Each year, the balance of a savings account is updated based on the interest rate. The interest rate the bank gives depends on the amount of money in the accounts (its balance):

- -3.213% for a negative balance.
- 0.5% for a non-negative balance less than `1000` dollars.
- 1.621% for a positive balance greater or equal than `1000` dollars and less than `5000` dollars.
- 2.475% for a positive balance greater or equal than `5000` dollars.

You have three tasks, each of which will deal with the balance and its interest rate.

### 1. Calculate the interest rate

Implement the `SavingsAccount.interest_rate` method to calculate the interest rate based on the specified balance:

```ruby
SavingsAccount.interest_rate(200.75)
#=> 0.5
```

Note that the value returned is an instance of `Float`.

### 2. Calculate the annual balance update

Implement the `SavingsAccount.annual_balance_update` method to calculate the annual balance update, taking into account the interest rate:

```ruby
SavingsAccount.annual_balance_update(200.75)
#=> 201.75375
```

Note that the value returned is an instance of `Float`.

### 3. Calculate the years before reaching the desired balance

Implement the `SavingsAccount.years_before_desired_balance` method to calculate the minimum number of years required to reach the desired balance:

```ruby
SavingsAccount.years_before_desired_balance(200.75, 214.88)
#=> 14
```

Note that the value returned is an instance of `Integer`.

##Â Key Takeaways 

* When dealing with negative floats we can use the `Interger#abv` instance method to make it positive 

* To calculate how many years it will take to reach a target balance we can keep calling the `annual_balance_update` method until it returns a value higher that the desired balance 

* Instead of using `if/else` statement. We can use a series of `return` statements. For each statement we initialize a range and use the `include?` method to check if the `balance` falls between that range. 

* Case statements can use `<` `>` if we dont specify a case 

  ```ruby
  case
  when balance < 0
  	-3
  when balance < 1000
  	0.5
  else
   2
  end
  ```

* Recursion call for the last task - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55175304/why-does-adding-1-to-a-recursive-proc-call-return-the-count-of-calls-made
  ```ruby
    def self.years_before_desired_balance(current_balance, desired_balance)
      return Float::Infinity if current_balance < 0
      return 0 if current_balance >= desired_balance
      years_before_desired_balance(annual_balance_update(current_balance), desired_balance) + 1
    end
  ```

  

* `balance * (1 + interest_rate(balance).abs/100)`

## Solutions

```ruby
module SavingsAccount
  def self.interest_rate(balance)
    if balance.negative?
      -3.213
    elsif balance >= 1000 && balance < 5000 
      1.621
    elsif balance >= 5000
      2.475
    else 
      0.5
    end
  end
	
  def self.annual_balance_update(balance)
    (balance * self.interest_rate(balance).abs) / 100 + balance
  end
	
  def self.years_before_desired_balance(current_balance, target_balance)
    counter = 0
    balance = current_balance
    while balance < target_balance
      balance = self.annual_balance_update(balance)
      counter += 1
    end
    counter
  end
  
=begin
  def self.years_before_desired_balance(current_balance, desired_balance)
  	counter = 0
    balance = current_balance
    loop do 
      break if balance > desired_balance 
      balance = annual_balance_update(balance)
      counter += 1
    end 
    return counter
  end
=end
  
end 
```

```ruby
module SavingsAccount
 	def self.interest_rate(balance)
   	return -3.213 if balance.negative?
    return 0.5 if (0...1000).include?(balance) # usage of range and then include method
    return 1.621 if (1000...5000).include?(balance)
    2.475
	end

  def self.annual_balance_update(balance)
    interest = balance.abs * (interest_rate(balance) / 100)
    balance + interest
  end
  
  def self.years_before_desired_balance(current_balance, desired_balance)
    each_new_balance(current_balance)
      .take_while { |new_balance| new_balance < desired_balance }
      .count + 1
  end

  def self.each_new_balance(balance)
    Enumerator.new do |y|
      loop do
        balance = annual_balance_update(balance)
        y << balance
      end
    end
  end
end
```
