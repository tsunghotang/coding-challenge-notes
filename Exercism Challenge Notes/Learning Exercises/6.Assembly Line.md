# Assembly Line

https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/exercises/assembly-line

---

In this exercise you'll be writing code to analyze the production of an assembly line in a car factory. The assembly line's speed can range from `0` (off) to `10` (maximum).

At its slowest speed (`1`), `221` cars are produced each hour. The production increases linearly with the speed. So with the speed set to `4`, it should produce `4 * 221 = 884` cars per hour. However, higher speeds increase the likelihood that faulty cars are produced, which then have to be discarded. The following table shows how speed influences the success rate:

- `1` to `4`: 100% success rate.
- `5` to `8`: 90% success rate.
- `9`: 80% success rate.
- `10`: 77% success rate.

You have two tasks.

### 1. Calculate the production rate per hour

Implement the `AssemblyLine#production_rate_per_hour` method to calculate the assembly line's production rate per hour, taking into account its success rate. Note that the value returned is an instance of `Float`.

```ruby
AssemblyLine.new(6).production_rate_per_hour
#=> 1193.4
```

### 2. Calculate the number of working items produced per minute

Implement the `AssemblyLine#working_items_per_minute` method to calculate how many **completed, working cars** are produced per minute. Note that the value returned is an instance of `Integer`.

```ruby
AssemblyLine.new(6).working_items_per_minute
#=> 19
```

* Create a hash storing the success rate 

```ruby
class AssemblyLine
  PRODUCTION_PER_HOUR = 221
	
  SUCCESS_RATE = {
    1 => 1.0,
    2 => 1.0,
    3 => 1,
    4 => 1,
    5 => 0.9,
    6 => 0.9,
    7 => 0.9,
    8 => 0.9,
    9 => 0.8,
    10 => 0.77
  }.freeze

  def initialize(speed)
    @speed = speed
  end
	def production_rate_per_hour
		@speed * PRODUCTION_PER_HOUR * SUCCESS_RATE[@speed]
	end

  def working_items_per_minute
    (production_rate_per_hour / 60).to_i
  end
end
```



We can also define an instance method that returns the `success_rate` 

```ruby
private
  def success_rate
    case @speed
    when 1..4
      1
    when 5..8
      0.9
    when 9
      0.8
    when 10
      0.77
    end
  end

```
