##Â Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

---

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## PEDAC

**Input**: array of integers 

**Output**: integer 

* Return maximum profit possible. 0 if no profit
  * Input array represents the price of a particular stock per day
  * We have to buy first before we can sell



* Initialize variable to store the highest profit possible
* Initialize variable to store the minimum price so far 
* Iterate thorugh the prices array
  *  Find the profit from selling at the current price vs the current minimum
  * Update max_profit if the current profit is higher 
  * Update the min_price_so_far 



Iterate through the prices array, and find the profit from selling at the current price by taking the difference between the current price and min_price_so_far Update the max_profit if the current profit is higher Update the min_price_so_far if the current price is lower return max_profit at the end of the loop
