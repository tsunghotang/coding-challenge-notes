## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

---

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## PEDAC

**Input**: array of integers 

**Output**: integer 

* Return maximum profit possible. 0 if no profit
  * Input array represents the price of a particular stock per day
  * We have to buy first before we can sell



* Initialize variable to store the highest profit possible - `max_profit` 
* Initialize variable to store the `minimum_price_so_far`
* Iterate thorugh the prices array
  * Find the profit from selling at the `current price`(current iteration) vs the current `minimum_price_so_far`
  * Update `max_profit` if the current profit is higher 
  * Update the minimum_price_so_far if the current price is lower 
* Return `max_profit`

## Solutions

### JavaScript

```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let maxProfit = 0
  let minimumPriceSoFar = prices[0]
  
  for(let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    profit = prices[i] - minimumPriceSoFar
    maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit)
    if (minimumPriceSoFar > prices[i]) minimumPriceSoFar = prices[i]
  }
  return maxProfit
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  let maxProfit = 0
  let l = 0 // buy
  let r = 1 // sell

  while(r < prices.length) {
    if (prices[l] < prices[r]) {
      profit = prices[r] - prices[l]
      maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit)
    } else {
      l = r
    }
    r += 1
  }
  return maxProfit
}

// Tests 
maxProfit([7,1,5,3,6,4])
maxProfit([7,6,4,3,1])
```

* Initialize `max_profit`variable set to `0`
* Initialize `r` local variable set to `0` - represents buy pointer
* Initialize `l` local variable set to `1` - represents sell pointer

* Initialize `while` loop. Break when `r` sell pointer reaches end of the array

  * Check if the buy pointer is less than the sell pointer (we need to buy before we can sell)

    * True 
      * Calculate profit (sell - buy). Save into `profit` variable
      * Reassign the `max_profit` variable to the highest value out of `max_profit` and `profit`
    *  False (sell pointer higher than buy pointer)
      * reassign buy pointer to the sell pointer

    * increment the sell pointer.

* Return `max_profit`
